  <p id="introduction">
    Crime rate prediction has become an important tool for law enforcement
    agencies to help them better understand patterns of crime and anticipate
    where crime is likely to occur. By predicting future crime trends, law
    enforcement agencies can better allocate resources to areas that are likely
    to experience increases in criminal activity. This could lead to a decrease
    in crime overall, as well as an increase in public safety. Additionally,
    crime rate prediction can help police departments develop better strategies
    for responding to crime as it happens.

    The dataset is prepared manually based on the publication available on the
    Indian National Crime Rate Bureau (NCRB) official website. This data
    provides statistics on crimes committed in 19 metropolitan cities during the
    year 2014 to 2021. With the help of this application, we can predict the
    crime rates for 10 different categories of crime that are likely to occur in
    19 Indian metropolitan cities over the next few years. It includes
    statistics on 10 different categories of crime, including murder,
    kidnapping, crime against women, crime against children, crime committed by
    juveniles, crime against senior citizens, crime against SC, crime against
    ST, economic offences and cyber crimes.

    The system uses scikit-learn's Random Forest Regression model, which takes
    year, city name, and crime type data as inputs. Random Forest Regression is
    a type of an ensemble learning techniques that can be used to predict
    continuous values from a collection of data. It works by creating a large
    number of "decision trees" which each make a prediction about the target
    variable. Then it averages all the predictions to come up with a final
    prediction. This makes it more accurate than a single decision tree. The
    model predicts the crime rate with an accuracy of 93.20% on testing dataset.
